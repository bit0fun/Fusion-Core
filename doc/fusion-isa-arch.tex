\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About}
\paragraph{Introduction}The Fusion-Core ISA is dedicated to creating an easily expandible architecture without having to 
recompile a program's binary. By use of defining an easy interface with a simple core instruction set, this allows for
more freedom in implementation. High end processors and microcontrollers would only require slight varaitions in
configuration, as their core would remain identical save for easy to maintain and scalable co-processors.
\paragraph{Main Ideas}The architecture is Big endian, with a core instruction set that is RISC, but the co-processors do not need to adhere to the RISC philosophy. This allows for more flexibility in design, and possibly faster core clock speeds as the pipeline would depend on smaller amounts of logic. Only the instructions provided in this document are to be implemented in the main processor. The co-processors defined in this document are recommended, but not required for normal function. Co-processor documentation is to be provided by the creator, and should adhere to the standards of clarity and conciseness such that it can be easily implemented from the documentation alone in a HDL. 
\paragraph{64 Bit instructions:}At this moment in time, the Fusion-Core ISA is only a 32 bit ISA. Due to the focus on co-processors,
older implementations could easily be modified to include 64 bit operations.
\paragraph{Co-Processors}The Co-Processor interface is currently defined by setting the MSB within the OP Code field of 
an instruction, to decrease complexity of the Decode unit. In doing so, this allows for coprocessor code to be written in the same memory space as the main processor code. In the current iteration, up to 32 different coprocessors can be used, with the option for dynamic or static allocation of the OP Codes. The interface for the coprocessors is explained further in the dedicated section.

\subsection{Goals}
\paragraph{}The main goal is to provide an architecture with a simple decoding unit and the ability to utilize a single binary for all implementations of the architecture.
\subsection{Conventions}
\paragraph{Document Conventions:}Example code will be shown with \texttt{monospace} text. General purpose registers will be denoted with
\$R\# where \# is the number of the register. Special purpose registers will be written with \textbf{bold} text.
%\paragraph{Naming Conventions:}The name of input signals will have "\_in" after the signal name, with "\_out" after output signals.
%This is mainly used in the verilog example implementation. If a naming convention is not globally used, it will be stated in the individual section that it pertains to. 

\part{Programming Information}
\section{Register File Definitions}
\paragraph{}This section goes over the different registers available in the ISA. Each register file name begins with 
"REGF", such as the first General Purpose Register File being REGFGP0. Any additional register files require the number after the
name of the register file. Register files with additional numbers after them are bank switched to reduce space, hence why the number is
required to denote the register file space used.
\paragraph{}To alleviate context switching delays, three general purpose register files are bank availble by bank switching. Only these register files are required
for a minimal system, though more can certainly be implemented if required. Each register file can be accessed by changing the value in the BSELRF register.

\subsection{General Purpose Registers}
\paragraph{}32 general purpose registers that are 32 bits wide are available, as shown in Figure 1, in the previous section. 
There is a distinction between the System Register File and the General Purpose Register File, as during certain syscall
instructions, the register files are bank switched. Only GP0 through GP7 are saved, for passing between the different banks. 

\paragraph{}While it is not defined by the architecture, larger general purpose registers can be used instead of 32 bit wide registers. The System Register File allows 8 bit addressing for the registers to be accessed, in order to utilize more of the memory space.
If larger registers are needed, consider using a co-processor to for instructions that require larger operands. 
This provides code compatibility between different implementations.
\subsection{Special Registers}
\paragraph{}The special registers are sorted between the System Registers and the Supervisor Registers. The system registers provide
simple configuration values and some read-only registers to give the programmer information about the implementation.
The registers defined in this manual are the bare minimum special purpose registers, and
should be included for code compatibility. \\
The supervisor registers are aimed at higher level functions required for operating system environments. They are not essential for operation,
and can either be partially implemented or not at all. The optional parts will be noted in the register descriptions.\\

highest permission level to avoid porting code. PEMA should also be hardcoded to a logic high for the same reasons stated.\\

\subsubsection{Supervisor Registers}
\paragraph{} This section is still being developed. It will be updated in the future.


\section{Permission Levels}
\paragraph{} The various permission levels are designed to allow for protected execution between user space, a kernel, and virtual
environments. Permission levels are changed through dedicated instructions to increase or decrease the permission level counter. System calls
can change the permission level in order to execute specific functions, but can be revoked in order to keep security. The individual function
calls can be defined in the System Call Function Pointer Table (SYSFPT). 
\paragraph{} On boot, the default permission level is initialized to the highest permission level in order to properly configure the processor.
There are no restrictionsto access. However, after configuration the permission level should be lowered as required to ensure secure execution.
\subsection{User Levels}

\subsubsection{Low User Level} User space processes are designed to run in this permission level. Write access to supervisor registers is revoked,
and all modifying system calls are checked for allowed execution. Low priority, non time sensitive applications, high security risk applications
should be run at this level. Since the Low User Level is the most restrictive priroity level, in the event of a illegal operation by the application
the processor should attempt to revert to a state before the illegal action and either kill or halt the offending process in order to prevent further
illegal actions. Halting the process should be used to determine more information about the illegal action, while killing the process is ideal for
more critical situations. 

\subsubsection{High User Level} This user level is designed to keep some security between user space and supervisor space, whiling loosening
restrictions. Only reads are allowed to system and supervisor registers, and a limited number of system calls will not need to be verified. 
The verifide system calls are specified in the 8 system call registers: SCPMHULX. Time critical user space processes, trusted system call 
saturated processes, and processes that require reading system and supervisor registers should use this permission level. 
registers. 

\subsection{Supervisor Levels}
\subsubsection{Low Supervisor Level} This permission level allows reads and writes to most system registers, with few restrictions. Hardware drivers,
real time processes, and non configuratory kernel tasks should use this level.
\subsubsection{High Supervisor Level} This permission level is for unrestricted access for operating system environments. Essential Kernel processes and
bare-metal embedded applications are examples for using this permission level. All configuration registers are available, only hypervisor configuration and
actions are restricted. If the hypervisor system is not implemented, this level is the highest permission level.

\subsection{Hypervisor Levels}
\paragraph{} This section is still under development. At this time, the Hypervisor levels simply allow access to all functions of a processor, including the
virturalization feeatures. Since the virturalization functions are not defined yet, this is a placeholder for the time being.

\subsubsection{Low Hypervisor Level}
\subsubsection{High Hypervisor Level}
\subsubsection{Top Hypervisor Level}

\section{Memory}
\paragraph{}At this point in time, the ISA only handles 32 bit addresses.
With memory capacity increasing in size as time goes on, this may change. %In order to access 
%larger sections of memory, the use of an offset register may be implemented to create 64 bit addresses.
%The use of virtual memory with said offset register is also accepted.
\paragraph{} The Fusion-ISA uses a modified harvard architecture, such that the programmer should have the appearance of a harvard architecture.
Compliance to this is not strict, as any variation inbetween is allowed, but the separation between data and instruction memory should be made.

\subsection{Memory Locations for Vector Table}
\subsubsection{Interrupt Vector Table}
\paragraph{} The table below is the definition for the Interrupt Vectors. The vectors are padded by two addresses
in order to give enough space for a call macro, which expands to two instructions. Additional interrupt vectors 
can be created, though the ones specified are necessary.

\section{Instruction Usage}
\paragraph{}This section will go over programming use of the instructions including the affects on the processor. Information on the 
instruction encodings and list of binary representations of each instruction is available in the 'Instructions' Section.
\subsection{Integer}
\paragraph{} The following instructions operate on two registers, RSa and RSb, and store the result into Rd. The Z and OV flags are affected
by the output of the instructions listed below. Overflows of register operations can be handled by the program, or the processor by checking the
OV flag in the \textbf{STAT} register, or enabling the ROI interrupt. The Z flag is available as well to the programmer, but it does not have
it's own interrupt to use. Since branch instructions exist to check if a register is equal to zero, the Z flag does not serve a purpose at this time.
\paragraph{} Since arithmetic functions are simple to explain, the following table will denote the operands and function of the Integer instructions.

\subsection{Instruction Format Types}
\paragraph{}This section will talk about the different instructions available in the core processor, their encodings, function, and hazards
they cause or registers they affect in the processor. The Co-Processor instructions are purlely generic and allow the implementation of
each Co-Processor to determine how their respective instructions will be decoded. Only the Operation Codes will be defined for each 
Co-Processor slot to allow for more customization.

\subsubsection{Integer}
\paragraph{}The interger instructions are the heart of this processor's arithmetic abilities and is vital to ensure fast execution. A semi-strict
adherence to RISC philosophy in this architecture is required to exploit any benefits to this ISA in a real implementation.
\paragraph{}The integer instruction coding with descriptions, is shown in the diagrams below.

\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
			\multicolumn{6}{c}{Register/Integer Instruction Format}\\ \hline
				\hspace{2pt} opcode (0x01) \hspace{2pt} & \hspace{5pt} rd \hspace{5pt} &  \hspace{4pt} rsa \hspace{4pt} & \hspace{4pt}rsb  \hspace{4pt}& \hspace{10pt}shft  \hspace{10pt} & \hspace{3pt} aluop \hspace{3pt}   \\	\hline

	\end{tabular}
\end{center}	
\paragraph{Overview:}The Register/Integer Instruction Format is for basic ALU operations, without immediates. Registers RSa and RSb are the two operands,which
are stored in register Rd. The 4 bit ALUOP field denotes the settings for the ALU, to reduce complexity of selecting what operation to choose.
The shft bits are only for the shift amount with the shifting instructions, but unused for other instructions. 
\paragraph{}The following instructions use this encoding:\\
\begin{center}

\end{center}
\paragraph{Overview:}The Immediate Instruction Format is for ALU operations that require an immediate value. The immediate field
is only 12 bits wide, so in the event that a larger value is required, the Load Immediate Format should be used. There is only a single
source register, RSa, with the other source being the immediate value. The result is stored into register Rd.

\paragraph{Overview:} The Jump Instruction format is for changing the Program Counter. 
All Jumps are relative, except Jump Register Instructions,
due to the non byte aligned size (20 bits) of the immediate field. Jumps use the value in register RSa to calculate
the new PC. For pure relative jumps, the Zero register is used as the base. For jump instructions that link the program counter, 
the PC is stored in RA0, or R4 in the General Purpose Register file.

\paragraph{} Each bit of the opcode directly affects the resources required for each instruction. This choice was made 
in hopes of reducing decode complexity. The MSB of the opcode selects if the instruction is for the co-processor,
or main core. This makes it incredibly easy to determine which core the instruction goes to, without sacrificing
more opcode bits. The LSB of the opcode selects ALU usage, the second to last bit selects the immediate field.
\paragraph{} However, in some cases the more significant bit will modify the functions of the later bits. The 3rd to last
bit in the opcode selects a change in PC, but the following bits do not correspond to the previous meanings mentioned. The
4th bit denotes a system instruction, and the 5th bit denotes memory access.

\part{Co-Processors}
\section{Co-Processor Overview}
\paragraph{}Co-processors are the main point of the Fusion-Core archetecture. As the ISA strictly specifies the main core for code compatibility,
the implementator is free to use whichever co-processors that would be necessary for an application. As speeding up the common case is the main goal in CPU design,
these co-processors should enhance the common case for the specific implementation. The ISA has no specific restrictions for a co-processor, but for non-memory
mapped co-processors, they should be created as dictated by the interface speicifed below.

\paragraph{} Examples of co-processors could be hardware acceleration for vector instructions, encryption, floating point, or communication.
The co-processor can be as complex, or as simple as one requires. There is no limitation for what kind of co-processor that could be used, 
only the number of co-processors that can utilize the opcode space allocated for co-processors. The co-processors can also share the same opcode, which
can help create vectorized instruction units such as GPU like co-processors, coupled directly to the main core's instruction flow. The programmer would
be able to exploit more locality in programming as switching to different sections of memory is not required. It should be noted that this last sentence is
not a requirement, but just a possibility and the current implementation of the default case for the GNU Binutils port. This can easily be modified with a 
custom linker script.

\paragraph{} The reasoning behind co-processors use is to allow for code compatibility between nearly all implementations of the Fusion-Core ISA, and
allowing for an enhancement to the common case of a processor's use. Most architectures do not allow for radical implementaitons in the architecture itself,
only the microarchitecture. And by keeping complex instructions away from the main core, a simple decode unit can be created to allow for potentially faster
pipelining. 

\subsection{Co-Processor Interface}

\paragraph{Co-Processor Opcode space} Co-processor instructions are enabled through use of the most significant bit of the opcode field. 
The processor should be able to distinguish between main core and co-processor instructions quickly, and a single bit is the simplest way of doing so.
The other 5 bits are completely usable for whichever purpose the implementation could desire.

\paragraph{} In order to let the programmer know what co-processors are available, the opcode registration table should contain the co-processor ID (CPID).
This ID is provided by the Fusion-Core developers. Please send an email to cpid@fusion-core.org for making requests for a new co-processor.
This ID will be implemented to allow for proper disassembly and assembly of the instructions in the GNU Binutils port. It is also possible to not use an official
CPID, however no support will be given to the developers of the co-processor.

\section{Global Register File}
\paragraph{}The Global Register File is for simple message passing, and creating locks between co-processors.
As it may be necessary to wait for a value to be computed by a co-processor, or lock specific parts of memory,
the Global Register File creates an interface for ease of use between processing units.
\paragraph{}This section is under development and will be updated to explain the connections and registers available.
